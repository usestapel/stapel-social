# Changelog

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- `stapel-core` ceiling raised `>=0.10,<0.11` → `>=0.10,<0.12` (core 0.11
  fleet re-pin). Member-module pins (chat, profiles, reviews) already
  satisfied by their own 0.11-fleet patch releases. Suite green as-is.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Initial composite (projections-and-composition §3): pyproject pins over
  the member modules, `preset` (INSTALLED_APPS/urls/STAPEL_* defaults),
  AppConfig app slot, minimal tests.

### Known gaps

- Likes/favourites wait for `stapel-engagement` (minor bump when it exists).
