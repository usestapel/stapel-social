"""Drift gate for the `surface` section of ``docs/capabilities.json``
(discoverability-design.md §1.2) — the third contract question, "is there
already a mechanism for X and what do I call?", after ``axes`` (switch on) and
``extension_points`` (replace).

stapel-social is a COMPOSITE PRESET (projections-and-composition §3): plain
INSTALLED_APPS/urls/config wiring over stapel-chat + stapel-profiles +
stapel-reviews, with no permission classes, no public functions, no
capability fields and no templates of its own. Its
``docs/capabilities.meta.json`` declares ``surface_roots: []`` on purpose —
there is nothing here a product should call INSTEAD of the member modules.
The gate below still runs: it makes sure that stays a stated decision, not
silent absence, and it will fail loudly the moment a real symbol appears in
this module without an explaining intent line.

Honest boundary: the REST of this module's ``capabilities.json`` is still
hand-written (no gate registry, no ``docs/schema.json``), so only
``module``/``version``/``surface`` are gated below.
